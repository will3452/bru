                Berkeley-Reagan University or BRU was founded on October 13 by a British teacher, named Henry Berkeley, and an American businessman, named William Reagan, who came to Taguig City, Philippines in 1951.

            <p class="text-2xl mt-4">
                From offering only four courses in natural sciences and performing arts as Berkeley-Reagan Colleges, it has expanded, not only its land area, but also the curriculum it offered over the years. It earned its University status in 1986, as more than eight thousand students from around Southeast Asia flocked its grounds, making it one of the most prestigious international universities in the world. In 1989, BRU began accepting students from Pre-K to Senior High, which now comprises its Integrated School population.

            <p class="text-2xl mt-4">
                At present, BRU specializes in Business, Sports, Arts and Social Sciences. Its British-American-inspired buildings withstood the test of time, boasting their original architectural designs and structures to date, along with state-of-the art facilities.
