            BRUMULTIVERSE is always in need of authors and artists, who see the world and the universe differently. We need you to help us inspire people to live their lives the way they are always meant to live it! We need you to help us awaken that spark of love, light and life within them through your stories and your artworks.

            For interested authors and artists, please send sample materials – short stories or first three chapters of a manuscript you’re working on or your visual works of art – to submissions@brumultiverse.com, along with a brief introduction about you and your artistic life. We will get back to you as soon as we can.
